# Firmware and hardware setup

## Firmware setup references

If you are new to Pico/MicroPython setup, these guides are useful:

- Thonny IDE: https://thonny.org/
- Raspberry Pi Pico getting started (step 3): https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-pico/3
- Waveshare Pico ePaper Python guide: https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Pico-ePaper-7.5#Python
- Video guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YvWT8bNllU

Firmware display driver behavior is aligned with Waveshare's Pico demo command sequence for the 2.13" B V4/WS-19588 panel to reduce compatibility issues with vendor examples.

## Single-file firmware bundle

If you want a copy/paste firmware script, use:

- `pico/firmware/pico_firmware_all_in_one.py`

This file is an all-in-one bundle of the firmware runtime (config, providers, HTTP handlers, display driver, and main loop) intended for direct deployment to Pico.

## Deploy to Pico with rshell

```bash
python -m venv .venv
pip install rshell
rshell
cd /pyboard
cp -r /home/fabio/Documents/proj/pico/lib ./
cp /home/fabio/Documents/proj/pico/main.py ./
```

## Troubleshooting serial logs

```bash
sudo screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200
```

OR

```bash
picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyACM0
```

Example output:

## Device settings

Wi-Fi credentials and provider tokens are **not** in source. `pico/config.py`
holds defaults that describe the shape of the configuration; the device's own
values live in `settings.json` on its filesystem, which is gitignored.

```sh
cp pico/settings.example.json settings.json   # then fill it in, then copy to the Pico
```

Anything omitted keeps the default. The overlay is applied at import, so every
module that does `from config import CONFIG` sees the device's values.

**A missing required value fails at startup, by name.** Falling back silently
produces a device that boots, connects to nothing and shows a dummy reading —
which reads as a broken provider rather than an empty password. All missing
values are listed in one error, because someone setting up a fresh device wants
the whole list at once.

**Only enabled providers need credentials.** The keyless ci-api needs no token;
demanding one would be a fallback of a different kind.

**An unknown setting is an error naming it.** A typo is the usual cause, and a
device that ignores half its configuration without saying which half is the
worst of the available outcomes.

The desktop side is unchanged: `config/settings.py` still reads environment
variables, and remains the source of truth there.
